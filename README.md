Just a HP laptop with macOS -- hakintosh
# Clover or Opencore?
I will start with clover, will convert to opencore ones the time is right.
# BigSur
Nope, not for now. After i have converted everything into OpenCore and it is stable i can upgrade to BigSur.
For now just Cataline. 
# What does work?
I have a working Icloud with facetime so thats nice. Wifi is not working as my chip is not the right brand. I will propably buy one, but not now, as those wifi chips are not really cheap. 
# Why?
It is a fun project, and, i kinda wanted a macbook, and now i sorta have. 
# Specs:
CPU: i7 8565U
GPU: MX250 can't be used as nvidea does not make drivers for it, for macOS
RAM: 16GB
