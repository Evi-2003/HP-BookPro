--
Just a HP laptop with macOS -- as some call it ... a hakintosh
# Clover or Opencore?
I started with Clover but now i converted everything into OpenCore
# BigSur
Yes! With the current OpenCore config it works perfectly fine.

( It is 15 inch but whatever )
# What does work?
Everything works, except the MX250 and wifi. The MX250 won't be working until nvidea releases web drivers which they won't. And for the wifi i will need to replace the wifi card in my laptop. For now i will need to use a wifi usb or ethernet. 
# Why?
It is a fun project, and, i kinda wanted a macbook, and now i sorta have. 
# Specs:
- CPU: i7 8565U
- GPU: MX250 can't be used as nvidea does not make drivers for it, for macOS..
- RAM: 16GB
- SSD: M.2 HP 500GB~
- 1920x1080 15inch Screen
