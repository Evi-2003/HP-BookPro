--
Just a HP laptop with macOS -- as some call it ... a hakintosh
# Clover or Opencore?
I started with Clover but now i converted everything into OpenCore
# BigSur
Nope, not for now. After i have converted everything into OpenCore and it is stable i can upgrade to BigSur.
For now just Cataline. I will do this later
# What does work?
I have a working Icloud with facetime so thats nice. Wifi is not working as my chip is not the right brand. I will propably buy one, but not now, as those wifi chips are not really cheap. I can use a wifi usb, but rather want native wifi. Ethernet works perfectly but for a laptop not really useful.
# Why?
It is a fun project, and, i kinda wanted a macbook, and now i sorta have. 
# Specs:
- CPU: i7 8565U
- GPU: MX250 can't be used as nvidea does not make drivers for it, for macOS..
- RAM: 16GB
- SSD: M.2 HP 500GB~
- 1920x1080 15inch Screen
# To-Do 
- [ ] Removing unnecessary stuff
- [X] Converting the whole thing into opencore
- [ ] Updating to bigsur after converted to opencore
- [ ] Chaning the wifi chip of my laptop, need to look which one....
